 1. Create an array called ages that contains the following values: 3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93.
    a. Programmatically subtract the value of the first element in the array from the value in the last element of the array.
       - Do not use numbers to reference the last element, find it programmatically.
       - ages[7] - ages[0] is not allowed!
